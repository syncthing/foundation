# The Syncthing Foundation

This repository contains the official, public documents of the Syncthing
Foundation. The Syncthing Foundation is a Swedish non-profit foundation
("stiftelse").

The foundation website is at https://www.syncthing.org/.

## Purpose

The foundation bylaws have this to say about the purpose of the foundation:

> The purpose of the foundation is to maintain and encourage development and
> usage of the free software Syncthing and its required infrastructure. The
> foundation can provide grants on its own initiative, or by application
> according to the rules put forth by the board.

This is quite general, and in practice it means the foundation pays for the
infrastructure required to run Syncthing (like this website, discovery
servers, build servers, and so on), but is open to providing grants for
specific projects that further the cause.
